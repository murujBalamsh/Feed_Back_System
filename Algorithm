//we work as a Group With bayan - khaled - abdulrahman

The working algorithm as follows , we used :-
-2 servo motor.      
- potentiometers to simulate the movement of the engine by hand. 
- push button to save the angle values.  

1- click on the button to start work of the electronic circuit.    
2- The engine angles are determined by reading the inputs and storing them in a variable x. 
3- The sensor reading is converted to values that suit the angles of the servo motor from 0-180 degrees and saving in a variable y.       
4- After the conversion process, the first servo motor is started.   
5- The angle values are saved in the
6- After a period of waiting for half a second, the second servo motor starts to move depending on the value of the angle witch saved of the first servo motor.
